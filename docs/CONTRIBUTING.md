# Contributing to AI/ML Internship Tracker

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repo uses a simple branch-based workflow:

- Create feature branches from `main`: `feature/<short-desc>`
- Commit small changes and open pull requests against `main`
- Include a short description and link screenshots for UI changes

Local dev

- Backend: cd backend && npm install && npm run dev
- Frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

Code style

- We will add ESLint/Prettier hooks. For now follow consistent style and small commits.

Reporting issues

- Open GitHub Issues for bugs or feature requests and assign labels.
